				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<p>
					Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
					JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a
					small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
					developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript,
					lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can
					be connected to thee objects of these environments to provide
					programmatic control over them
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
						<p>
							JavaScript variables are containers for stroing data valies -
							imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a
							variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be
							identified with unique names. These unique names are called
							indentifiers, <span>var x;</span>
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign
						values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffe poured
						in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The - assignment
						operator assigns a value to a variable <span>var x = 10;</span>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to
						beable to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There
						are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -
						<span>true</span> or <span>false</span>; null aka
						<span>nothing</span>; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo
						Rocks!"; Array - <span>[1,"coding",2,"Dojo"]</span> and Object -
						<span>{first_name:"Jane",last_name:"Doe"}</span>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="#">Condition</a> When you write code, you want to perfrom
						different actions for different decisions - hitting different code
						blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
						conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are
						the following vonditional statements; if a specified condtion is
						true, to this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to
						specify a new condtion to test, if the first condtion is false,
						<span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in
						every programming language, but they all essentially do the same
						thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you
						have to run a mile, well you run around the track foud times and
						then you stop. That's a loop !
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code
						block. Wjen we call our function this will run that code block.
						Think of it as a list of instructions. As an exampple imagine we are
						putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual
						and get started, first, we screw the legs to the table top; next we
						place the table the right way up. Done ! We finished our
						instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call
						our functions over and over and over again
